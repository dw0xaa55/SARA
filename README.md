Description:
This program is meant for use with data obtained by the SALSA Telescope located in Onsala, Sweden.
The spectral data can be cleaned from background noise and normalized for displaying coordinates
of HI clouds which are calculated from the available data.
This program is currently in alpha state so expect it to behave buggy from time to time.


Installation:
make
sudo make install

Deinstallation:
sudo make uninstall

If you want to uninstall the program use
sudo make uninstall


Disclaimer:
I am by no means a professional coder in C or the GTK Framework. Basically that means, I tought it
to myself. So expect this code not to be very clean or elegant. I plan to optimize the source code
in the future, which will take some time, because therefore many things have to be learned to be
achieved.
In the mean time: Have fun using this version of SARA :>
